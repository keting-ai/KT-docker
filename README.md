# ktdocker
ktdocker is a simple container implementation, imitating the docker.  
This project refers to code in the book "Write docker yourself".
This project isn't completed yet. I haven't implemented many features -- just for fun!  
The basic is: 
1. Using Namespace to isolate resources
2. Using Cgroup to limit the resources
  
Available features are:  
- Init a container  
- Run a container  
- Execute a container  
- Stop a container  
- Remove a container
  
Not yet implemented:  
- Commit a container to an image  
- Container network  
- Remote Repository
